# Smart Tic-Tac-Toe

The "Tic Tac Toe" is a very classic puzzle game with simple operation and great entertainment. Two players, one in a circle (O), one in a fork (X), take turns to play their own symbols on a 3 by 3 grid, the first to be horizontal, straight, and oblique to form a line to win.

If both parties are correct, they will get a tie. This game is actually controlled by the first player, the first player is the attack and the second player is the defender.
